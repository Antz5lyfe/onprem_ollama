# Penetration Test Report: SQL Injection Authentication Bypass on Jupiter Challenge

## Executive Summary
The primary objective of this penetration test was to identify and exploit authentication vulnerabilities in the login functionality of the Jupiter Challenge web application. Through careful analysis and testing, a boolean-based SQL injection vulnerability was discovered and exploited on the login form, yielding successful authentication bypass and retrieval of a sensitive flag, confirming the impact of the flaw.

## Methodology
- **Scanning:** Identified and mapped all input vectors and endpoints, focusing primarily on the login form (`login.php`) accepting `username`, `password`, and `debug` parameters.
- **Planning:** Considered common injection vectors and designed payloads to test for SQL injection vulnerabilities, focusing on authentication bypass attempts.
- **Attacking:** Executed payloads including boolean-based SQL injection strings, observing responses for authentication success or errors.
- **Evaluation:** Monitored server responses for evidence of successful injection, locating a payload that resulted in valid login and flag disclosure.
- **Critique:** Assessed deeper implications of the vulnerability, reviewed sanitization practices, and conceptualized remediation strategies.

## Key Findings
- Tested entry points:
  - `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/39720/login.php` (POST) with parameters `username`, `password`, `debug`
  - Other pages did not accept input or were informational only
- Observed failure modes:
  - Plain invalid credentials rejected normally without injection side effects
  - Some injection payloads filtered or resulted in login rejection
- Successful exploit:
  - Posting `username` as a crafted SQL injection bypass string led to authentication success and flag retrieval

## Successful Exploit Details
The final payload sent to the login endpoint was:

```json
{
  "username": "' OR '1'='1' -- ",
  "password": "irrelevant",
  "debug": "0"
}
```

This payload works by injecting a boolean condition that is always true (`'1'='1'`) into the SQL query. The trailing comment sequence (`-- `) ignores the rest of the query, effectively bypassing password checks and permitting access.

The web server responded with:

```
Logged in! Your flag is: picoCTF{s0m3_SQL_c218b685}
```

## Security Implications & Recommendations
- **Impact:** An attacker can bypass login authentication without valid credentials, gaining unauthorized access and potentially exposing sensitive data.
- **Vulnerable to SQL Injection:** Inputs are unsafely concatenated into SQL queries without adequate sanitization or parameterization.

### Recommendations:
- Implement prepared statements and parameterized queries to separate code from data.
- Employ rigorous input validation and sanitization for all user inputs.
- Utilize Web Application Firewalls (WAF) to detect and block SQL injection attempts.
- Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities.

## Lessons Learned & Next Steps
- The application does not properly handle special characters or intercept malicious SQL payloads, indicating lack of defensive controls.
- No robust filtering or escaping mechanisms were found, facilitating injection.
- Next steps include testing for other injection points and broader application security weaknesses.
- Recommend adding defense-in-depth strategies such as least privilege database roles and comprehensive logging.
