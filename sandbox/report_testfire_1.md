# Penetration Test Report: SQL Injection on https://demo.testfire.net/

## Executive Summary
This report outlines a penetration test conducted against https://demo.testfire.net/ with the objective of identifying SQL Injection vulnerabilities. The test successfully bypassed authentication on the login form using a crafted SQL Injection payload, granting administrative access. This confirms the presence of an exploitable SQL Injection flaw allowing authentication bypass.

## Methodology
- **Scanning:** Analyzed the web application to identify input points including login, search, and feedback forms.
- **Planning:** Selected critical input parameters for injection attempts, focusing on authentication and data retrieval.
- **Attacking:** Applied traditional and crafted SQL Injection payloads across POST and GET parameters, prioritizing the login endpoint.
- **Evaluation:** Monitored responses to detect errors or unexpected behavior indicating injection success.
- **Critique:** Verified that only login form was vulnerable while other inputs showed no exploitable behavior under test conditions.

## Key Findings
- Tested entry points:
  - `POST https://demo.testfire.net/doLogin` with parameters: `uid`, `passw`, `btnSubmit`
  - `GET https://demo.testfire.net/search.jsp` with parameter: `query`
  - `POST https://demo.testfire.net/sendFeedback` with parameters: `name`, `email_addr`, `subject`, `comments`, `cfile`
- Observed no SQL errors or injection success in search and feedback forms.
- Successfully exploited the login form using SQL Injection to bypass authentication.

## Successful Exploit Details
- **Entry Point:** `POST https://demo.testfire.net/doLogin`
- **Payload:**

```json
{
  "uid": "admin' OR '1'='1'-- ",
  "passw": "anything",
  "btnSubmit": "Login"
}
```
- **Why It Worked:** The payload injected into the `uid` field manipulates the SQL query logic to always return true by using the condition `' OR '1'='1'--`, effectively bypassing username verification and allowing login without correct credentials.
- **Response Excerpt:** `Hello Admin User\nWelcome to Altoro Mutual Online.`

## Security Implications & Recommendations
- **Impact:** An attacker can bypass authentication, gaining administrative access without valid credentials. This compromises the entire application, risking data exposure and unauthorized actions.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Implement parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent injection.
  - Employ input validation and sanitization.
  - Use Web Application Firewalls (WAF) to detect and block injection payloads.
  - Conduct regular security assessments and code audits.

## Lessons Learned & Next Steps
- SQL Injection remains a critical risk if input is not properly sanitized.
- Other input points such as search and feedback forms showed no signs of injection vulnerability under tested conditions.
- Further testing could include blind SQL Injection techniques, response time analysis, and deeper WAF evasion tests.
- Immediate remediation should focus on fixing authentication bypass to prevent privilege escalation.
