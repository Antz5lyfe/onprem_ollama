# Security Assessment Report: picoCTF Jupiter Challenge

## Executive Summary
This assessment targeted the login functionality of the picoCTF Jupiter Challenge web application to test for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. The objective was to verify authentication robustness through the login form inputs. Our testing revealed a SQL injection vulnerability allowing authentication bypass, culminating in the retrieval of sensitive challenge data (the flag). This demonstrates that the application does not properly sanitize inputs in the login mechanism.

## Methodology
- **Scanning:** We enumerated all input endpoints on the application, discovering a login form with fields `username`, `password`, and a hidden `debug` parameter.
- **Planning:** Based on scanning, we prioritized testing SQL injection on the login form to attempt an authentication bypass.
- **Attacking:** We performed SQL injection payload tests and successfully bypassed authentication by injecting a comment sequence in the username.
- **Evaluation:** The payload allowed us to log in as an administrative user without a valid password, confirming the vulnerability.
- **Critique:** Limited error feedback from the server complicated injection testing, requiring crafted payloads for success.

## Key Findings
- **Entry Points Tested:**
   - POST `/login.php` with parameters: `username`, `password`, `debug`.

- **Observed Failure Modes:**
   - Generic "Login failed." message on most payloads.
   - No visible SQL error messages, no input reflections.

- **Successful Exploit:**
   - Authentication bypass by using SQL injection in `username` field.

## Successful Exploit Details
The final successful payload used was:

```http
POST /login.php HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

username=admin' -- &password=doesntmatter&debug=0
```

- **username:** `admin' -- `  
  Injects a comment sequence after the username filtering, effectively terminating the SQL query early and bypassing the password check.
- **password:** `doesntmatter` (not evaluated due to injection)
- **debug:** `0`

This technique exploits the SQL query to ignore the password condition and authenticate as "admin" directly.

## Security Implications & Recommendations
- **Impact:** Full authentication bypass allows unauthorized access to administrative accounts, risking complete compromise of the application.
- **Remediation:**
  - Implement parameterized queries or prepared statements to avoid injection.
  - Validate and sanitize all user inputs strictly.
  - Employ Web Application Firewalls (WAF) to detect and block suspicious inputs.
  - Conduct code reviews focusing on security for authentication modules.

## Lessons Learned & Next Steps
- The application does not provide SQL error feedback, which complicates attack vector development but does not prevent successful injection.
- The presence of a hidden `debug` parameter does not affect injection but should be audited for potential misuse.
- Future testing should explore other input vectors and deeper privilege escalation post-authentication.
- Defensive measures like input sanitation, use of ORM frameworks, and deployment of WAF rules are critical next steps.
